# The-Classical-World


This ruleset mod endeavors to reimagine the Classical World in UnCiv.

- No advances beyond the Classical Era. 
- Starting at 8000 BCE with adjusted speed and research costs. 
- Robust Technology Tree offers flexibility but discourages "rushing" playstyle.
- Buildings have been added along with changes to unit promotions.

I have taken a modular approach to ensure the mod stays playable as it is being worked on. 

- The Classical World Tech Tree: ✅ (99% until whole is done)

Technology tree with applicable buildings. 

- The Classical World Policies: ✅

All Policies revised for Ancient and Classical Eras.

- The Classical World Religions:

Religions tailored for Ancient and Classical Eras.

- The Classical World Wonders:

Some new additions, changes and removal of some Wonders.  Every Classical Civilization gets Civ-unique Wonders, no more Great Pyramids in Rome anymore! Even the Renowned Roman Engineers had to limit Monument stealing to Obelisks.

- The Classical World City-states:

Mostly renaming to avoid Vancouver in Carpathia, etc. Will likely incorporate changes from other city-state mods.

- The Classical World Civilizations List

The following 24 Civs will be imported or created for play in The Classical World:

- Aksum

- Armenia

- Assyria

- Babylon

- Byzantium

- Carthage

- Celtic Tribes

- China

- Dacia

- Egypt

- Epirus

- Germanic Tribes

- Greece

- Harappa

- Israel

- Maurya

- Persia

- Phoenicia

- Rome

- Scythia

- Sumeria

- The Hittites

- The Huns




- The Classical World Map:

 The go-to map for the Classical World, will have a starting location for each civilization. The map will be based on the Greco-Roman map, and yes, Ancient China is included.

-----------------------------------

"Classical antiquity, historical period spanning from the output of ancient Greek author Homer in the 8th century BCE to the decline of the Roman Empire in the 5th century CE. It encompassed Greco-Roman culture, which played a major role in the Mediterranean sphere of influence and in the creation of Western civilization, shaping areas as diverse as law, architecture, art, language, poetry, rhetoric, politics, and philosophy." ~ Encyclopedia Britannica
